I recently redesigned my website. Previously it was powered by wordpress and hosted in wordpress.com. But most of the internet provider of Bangladesh blocks that site because of some atheist online activist use that platform to host their blog.

Then I moved that to self hosted wordpress and manage it my myself. But it become a pain in the ass to manage. So, I decided to move that for a alternative. After a bit research, I decided to migrate to github powered static site.
